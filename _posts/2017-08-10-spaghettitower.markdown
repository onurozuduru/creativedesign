### Let's Make a Tower

Today, I attended the first lecture of `Creative Design and Prototyping` course.
In the lecture, we got the general course information and made one exercises which
was creating a tower by using tape and 13 spaghettis. We worked as pairs of 2
during this exercise.

In this post, there are two main parts:

1. Progress of the exercise.
2. Result and Reflection.

#### Challenge

These were the elements that we had, tape and spaghetti to build a tower and pen,
paper to design.

Rules:

- Use all spaghetti pieces.
- Maximum 3 of them can be used as broken, other than that they must be in one piece.
- Tower must stand until end of judgment process.
- 15 minutes to design.
- 15 minutes to build.

Grading criteria:

- Height of the tower.
- Robustness.
- Beauty.

#### Design

Our idea was to use tape as support material and making a tower on top of triangle base.
We thought to make it more strong by putting crosses to every faces. We planned to put
a pyramid shape "roof" on top of the first "floor".

Above was our quick sketch and calculation.

#### Build

As I mentioned we used, tape as supporting material. So, it is
possible to see tape at base and in the middle as layers, beside joint points.
That approach let us to use less spaghetti with a little bit stronger design.
We sacrificed one spaghetti piece for the base of the tower. We cut it in 3
pieces and used tape to create a base. Below image shows result of the exercise.

It was about 49 cm. Definitely, not the highest one :smile:

#### Reflection

I think our mistake was putting these crosses to sides of the tower. We could
have used lots of tape instead of tower and we could have used these spaghettis
to build higher tower. However, at the end I had fun and learned to look materials
from a different perspective.

In my opinion to make a good spaghetti tower below points are important.

- Use triangle base, it provides robust base without wasting too much spaghetti.
- Use tape as supporting material instead of using it only for join the spaghettis.
- Select one of the goals. It might be a tall and fragile tower or it might be
strong but shorter tower.

Other than the exercise, I want to add couple words about my documenting. I think
I could have taken more pictures. And landscape pictures might be more useful and
good looking than portrait pictures.

For the first one, I only have these portrait pictures, but next time
I will make it better.

#### Dust to Dust, Garbage to Garbage

So, this was the end of first `blog post/exercise documentation`.
You can see the very last result of today's lecture.
