Today we learned three creative ideatetion methods.

- Property mapping method.
- Mind map method.
- Brainwriting / 6-3-5 method.

We had 2 indivudual tasks and 1 task with 5 people group.

## Task 1: Property Mapping Method

In this task, it was asked to choose five living things and five man-made objects. After that, I followed the below steps:

- Combine them.
- Select pairs that seems interesting.
- Create new concept by using the `a <man-made object> like a <living thing>` formula.

I created 4 concepts by using my pairs: 

- A bicycle with wheels like a snake.
- A frog car to jump a place when there is traffic :smile:
- A bird-computer, the computer that makes calculation by using birds. They will solve problems to get food and these solutions actualy will be the logic gates in CPU.
- Flying Phone. When your phone realized it is falling down, it will begin to fly and land on the place that it began to fall.

All of them are crazy but it was fun to imagine to live in a crazy world.

## Task 2: Mind Map Method

In this task, the topic was mosquitos. First everyone created their own mind maps, then we combined them as one.

I imagined them as *bad boys of the town* who are called as *MosQ* before begin to create.

## Task 3: Brainwriting / 6-3-5 Method

In this method, everyone propose 3 ideas about the problem then pass the sheet to next person. After recieving other person's sheet, two actions can be done: improve the previous idea or suggest a totally new solution. This process goes until everyone ends up with the first sheet they have at the beginning.

6-3-5 refers 6 people, 3 ideas, 5 minutes. We were only 5 people so, it was 5-3-5 in our case.

Below picture shows the sheet that I began with at the end. The first column belongs to me and it can be seen how it went during the exercise.

## Reflection

Today, I had fun more than other lectures. It was very nice to learn ideatation mehods and going crazy while creating new ideas. At the beginning, I could not be sure about what was the point of doing this but, after exercises, I got the point.

In addition, I learned it is better to sketch your ideas than only writing them.
