In this exercise session, we worked as 2 people teams. First we picked a design problem and tried to create solutions by using heuristics cards.

Each person had 10 random cards to use during the exercise. In team work, we merged our cards so we had 20 cards as team.

Steps in exercise were:

1. Select one of the problems that is listed in the class.
2. Individually, propose at least 5 ideas by using your cards.
3. Present your ideas to your teammate.
4. Decide one final idea with your teammate and sketch it.
5. Explain your team's _the idea_ and tell which cards are used.

### Select a Problem

The problems in the lecture are listed below.

> 1. Design a product for a summer-like experience in dark and cold winter in Oulu.
> 2. Design a novel salt and pepper shaker set.
> 3. Design a product that utilize sunlight for heating and cooking food.
> 4. Design a product that uses leftover FabLab materials.

We decided to go for problem number 1, Design a product for a summer-like experience in dark and cold winter in Oulu.

### Find Ideas by Yourself

I got my 10 random cards to create my ideas. The important part was these were only design ideas so, it could be very crazy. Also, in some cards it was suggested to go for crazy ideas.

The first exercise sheet and my cards can be seen as below images.

I came up with five ideas by using five cards. My ideas were;

- Building an underground summer city and living there during summer. This is inspired by the card which says mimic the nature. I thought during winter some animals live under the ground so, we can do it too (Nope!).
- Creating a berry picking area in huge greenhouse. One of the cards was about adding idea to existing product. I added berry picking idea to greenhouse.
- Sunbath during winter. There was a card in my hand which said "Extend Surface". I thought there might be very large solarium and people can hang out under it like they are on beach.
- I designed one no snow area with repeat card, there would be fire places to warm up.
- And with subsitute way of achieving function card, I thought replacing water with mosquito spray smell in shower. In that way, you can smell the spray during summer too.

After we created our ideas, we presented them to our teammate.

### Create The Idea

After we talked about our ideas we decided to merge some of them and create one huge dome that mimics summer inside.

## Reflection

I think these cards were very useful in creation process. They inspire and give idea while building your design.

After I saw these cards, I decided to use some of the methods on them during my project design process. My topic is creating a personal seating object. I might use repeating method which I saw some designes that are related with it.
