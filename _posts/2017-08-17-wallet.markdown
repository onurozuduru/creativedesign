Today the exercise was about designing a new wallet for needs. First, we created a design in our minds and then we created one for our partner.

This exercise was with 2 people and each of us designed a wallet for the other.

## My Ideal Wallet

In my designed, I focused my problem which is having too many credit cards and other plastic cards. I designed a foldable wallet which is size of a paper money when it is opened. And the half size of the money when it is folded.

I thought, it is useful to have an e-paper as a screen on the outside of the wallet and embedded electronic material inside so, it would be possible to load card information on it. In that way, I aimed to solve carrying too many cards issue.

## Designing a Wallet for My Partner

Second part of the exercise was creating a wallet for my partner. That part had 9 stages. I took notes on the paper and put pictures of my notes and ideas below.

I think challenges and notes explain themselves therefore, I will bot comment on them.

So, my idea was having a smart creadit card inside wallet and a foldable 3 pockets for cash. And it has one zipper to lock it.

I found that my partner's problem was having cash and credit cards in a small place.

## Reflection

Today, we focused on creating a new solution for another person's needs.

In my design, I got below feedbacks from my partner:

- If there are too many coins, It might not be possible to use swape area of the card.

- I thought screen can be turn off automatically, but my partner suggested that putting a cover for screen to protect screen from scratches and to not show your details everytime. This was a simple solution for that problem. *I wish I had it before.*

I learned that digging deep to someone else's problem and finding out of the box solutions today. Therefore, it was the main point of today's exercise in my opinion.
