In this exercise, we had a challenge to find a solution for keeping an egg to break
after dropping it from a high distance.

Class is divided as two groups of three people. First of all we tried to find solutions
for the challenge individually and note them on post-its. Then we made morphological analysis
of every people's solutions. Below images show my solutions and the last analysis.

My favorite solution was below one that came up from a friend. Isn't it cool?

After we divided into teams. In my team, we decided to merge lots of ideas which were
wrapping it, putting it in a case and then put a parachute on it. We were allowed to
use materials in FabLab. We used bubble plastic and balloons with a plastic case and
straws to keep parachute open.

First challenge was in FabLab from 2nd floor to 1st floor.

And it survived! After that we went to our engineering building and repeat the process
from 3rd floor.

And it survived again! It was very fun to do it. In addition, I learned a new method to
find solutions.

## Reflection

In this exercise, we mostly spend our time to make the prototype. However, I learned how to work with
post-its and what is Morphological Analysis. The best part about post-its was it was easy to organize
ideas on board. Because, the categories that you saw in images was not created directly. First we
analyzed ideas then put them on board and created new categories and change their place based on that.
