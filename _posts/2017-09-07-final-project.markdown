For the project of course, there were two options to make prototype: surprising
device or personal seating furniture. I chose to design and make prototype of a
seating object.

During the course my ideas about my project changed. My first idea was to create
a foldable chair that can be used as a bench for multiple people to sit and capable
become an arm chair when it is folded. However, I got stuck on deciding design.
While I was trying to find new ideas or solutions, I got idea from one of the cards
that we used in exercise. There was "Repeating" as design idea.

I decided to make small chair that can be easily made and sized for the person who would use it
by idea of repeating same pattern. In my design, I tried to make one module of the chair
and user can be arrange the wide by cutting more modules.

I used cardboard to do it because it is easy to use and easy to carry. Design was
aimed to be simple therefore, there is one body design and one combiner. I made the legs
as this to place them more combined on the vector space. Point is to use less material and
being able to cut one module by one cutting job.

First, I cut a small version of the design to see is there any problem. And of course,
there was a problem, pieces for combination did not matched with the material. After
some trials, I found the measurement for my material.

I had these weird shapes at edges of the combination pieces to add modules together.
After test version had been success, I created a larger version. However, I decided to
put one less piece and to use empty place as module combiner, it was more robust than previous solution.

Below images shows the last prototype. I thought, it is used with a pillow on it. However, I could not
find a pillow to put on it and take a picture.

## Reflection

During design and cut process I learned many things such as the solution to combine modules,
how idea can be changed, and getting help from these idea cards.

There were some points that must be noted. First of all, design was robust enough to stand but
it was possible to move it left and right. This problem might be corrected by adding 90
degrees combination pieces. Actually, I designed it in Inkscape, it must be designed in a 3D tool.
Since, it is easy to decide measurement for material.

At the end, I made a prototype that matches with my goal and learn how to make prototype.
